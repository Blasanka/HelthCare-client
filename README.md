HelthCare-client

HelthCare is a Hospital Management System developing for Y3S2 PAF project. This is the client for web services implemented using Jersey 
JAX-RS implementation(repository: https://github.com/Blasanka/HelthCare-api).


•	A clickable link to the repository: https://github.com/Blasanka/helthcare-client
•	My function is Appointment.
•	A war file is added to the repository.
•	Also when providing the API forgot to add SQL backup to the repo and in this repo it is added.
•	And few more details are also included in the repository.
•	I used the build API for this web client using Jersey Client.
•	The API repository is https://github.com/Blasanka/healthcare-api and that repository contains few branches because I have done Appointment and User functions. Also a branch for monolithic integration and tried micro services integration using maven.
•	The master branch only contains Appointment service which is not contain x-authorization implementation but it is there in other branches.
